# Decision-Trees-as-Interpretable-Models
- Download the Accute Inflamations data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Acute+Inflammations
- Build a decision tree on the whole data set and plot it.
- Convert the decision rules into a set of IF-THEN rules.
- Use cost-complexity pruning to find a minimal decision tree and a set of decision rules with high interpretability.
